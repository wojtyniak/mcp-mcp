![MCP-MCP: An MCP server that helps discover other MCP servers](assets/matryoshka.jpg)

**MCP-MCP** is a Meta-MCP Server that acts as a tool discovery and provisioning service for the [Model Context Protocol (MCP)](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/). When an AI assistant needs a capability that isn't currently available, it can ask MCP-MCP to discover and suggest appropriate MCP servers from a comprehensive database of over a thousand servers aggregated from multiple curated sources.

Think of it as a "phone book" for MCP servers - one tool to find all other tools.

## üóÉÔ∏è **1,488+ MCP Servers Available**

MCP-MCP provides access to a comprehensive database aggregated from multiple curated sources, including:

- **Official MCP Servers** (modelcontextprotocol/servers)
- **Community Collections** (Punkpeye & Appcypher awesome lists)  
- **Intelligent Deduplication** ensures no duplicates across sources

The database is automatically updated every 3 hours with the latest servers from the community.

## Motivation

**Agents Just Wanna Have Tools** 

- **Agents know what they need**: AI assistants can clearly articulate requirements like "check domain availability" or "get weather data"
- **Web search isn't always enough**: Generic search results don't always provide realtime data
- **CLI tools require setup**: Many tools need complex installation, configuration, and API keys - agents have to repeat this setup every single time they need to complete a task
- **MCP servers are scattered**: Great tools exist but discovering them requires manual research across GitHub, forums, and documentation

Why make agents (and users) hunt for tools when we can bring the tools to them?

## Quick Start

## Claude Desktop Configuration

Add MCP-MCP to your Claude Desktop configuration file:

### Configuration File Location:
- **macOS**: `~/Library/Application\ Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`
- **Windows**: `%APPDATA%\Claude\claude_desktop_config.json`

### Configuration:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "mcp-mcp": {
      "command": "uvx",
      "args": ["mcp-mcp"]
    }
  }
}
```

### Alternative with pipx:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "mcp-mcp": {
      "command": "mcp-mcp"
    }
  }
}
```

## Claude Code Configuration

Add MCP-MCP to your Claude Code configuration file:

```bash
claude mcp add mcp-mcp uvx mcp-mcp
```

## Usage Examples

Once configured, you can ask Claude Desktop to discover MCP servers using natural language:

- **"Find me an MCP server for weather data"**
- **"I need a server for checking domain availability"** 
- **"Search for MCP servers related to stock market data"**
- **"What MCP servers are available for web scraping?"**

## Development

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.13+
- [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) package manager
- [direnv](https://direnv.net/) (optional, for automatic environment setup)
- [just](https://just.systems/) (optional, for convenient development commands)

### Setup

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/your-username/mcp-mcp.git
cd mcp-mcp

# Install dependencies
uv sync

# Run tests
uv run pytest

# Run the server
uv run main.py
```

### Install via uvx (for testing)

For testing the installed package:

```bash
uvx mcp-mcp
```

This installs and runs the MCP-MCP server directly via uvx.

### Development Commands (with justfile)

This project includes a `justfile` for common development tasks:

```bash
# List all available commands
just help

# Development with auto-reload
just dev      # STDIO mode with file watching
just dev-http # HTTP mode with file watching

# Running without auto-reload
just run-stdio # STDIO mode
just run-http  # HTTP mode

# Testing
just test             # Unit tests only
just test-integration # Include GitHub integration tests

# Building and publishing
just build           # Build package
just publish-test    # Publish to Test PyPI
just publish-prod    # Publish to Production PyPI

# Utilities
just version # Show version
just clean   # Clean build artifacts
```

### Development Mode

For development and testing, use HTTP transport (easier to stop with Ctrl+C):

```bash
# HTTP mode (accessible at http://localhost:8000)
uv run main.py --http
# OR with justfile:
just run-http

# With auto-reload during development
just dev-http

# Custom host/port
uv run main.py --http --host 0.0.0.0 --port 3000

# STDIO mode (for MCP clients like Claude Desktop)
uv run main.py  # Note: To stop STDIO mode, use Ctrl+D (EOF), not Ctrl+C
# OR with justfile:
just run-stdio

# With auto-reload during development
just dev
```

### Building

```bash
# Build package
uv build
# OR with justfile:
just build

# Test local installation
uvx --from ./dist/mcp_mcp-0.1.0-py3-none-any.whl mcp-mcp
```

## Command Line Options

```bash
mcp-mcp --help
```

| Option | Description | Default |
|--------|-------------|---------|
| `--transport {stdio,http}` | Transport method | `stdio` |
| `--http` | Use HTTP transport | - |
| `--host HOST` | Host for HTTP transport | `localhost` |
| `--port PORT` | Port for HTTP transport | `8000` |

## Testing

```bash
# Run all tests (unit + integration)
uv run pytest
# OR with justfile:
just test

# Run only unit tests (fast, no network)
uv run pytest db/ -v
# OR with justfile:
just test-unit

# Run only integration/e2e tests
uv run pytest tests/ -v
# OR with justfile:
just test-integration

# Run GitHub integration tests (optional, requires network)
MCP_MCP_TEST_GITHUB_INTEGRATION=1 uv run pytest tests/
# OR with justfile:
just test-integration-github

# Run all tests including GitHub integration
MCP_MCP_TEST_GITHUB_INTEGRATION=1 uv run pytest
# OR with justfile:
just test-all

# Run with coverage
uv run pytest --cov=db
```

**Test Structure**:
- **Unit Tests**: Located in `db/` alongside the code they test (Go-style)
- **Integration/E2E Tests**: Located in `tests/` directory

**Integration Tests**: Set `MCP_MCP_TEST_GITHUB_INTEGRATION=1` to test real GitHub downloads and verify the complete first-user onboarding experience. These tests ensure users get fast startup (< 5 seconds) with 1,488+ servers.

## Roadmap
